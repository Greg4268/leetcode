## 🔍 How to Navigate

1. **Browse by Problem Name**: Each problem is in its own directory named after the LeetCode problem title 
2. **Read the Solution**: Check the `[problem-name].md` file for detailed explanation
3. **Study the Code**: Review the `[problem-name].py` file for the implementation
4. **Understand Complexity**: Each solution includes time and space complexity analysis

## 📝 Solution Format

Each `[problem-name].md` follows this structure:

- **Problem Statement**: Brief description of the problem
- **Approach**: Explanation of the solution strategy
- **Algorithm Steps**: Step-by-step breakdown
- **Code Walkthrough**: Line-by-line explanation of key parts
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity
- **Alternative Solutions**: Other approaches (when applicable)

## 🚀 Running the Solutions

All solutions are written in Python 3. To run any solution:

```bash
cd problems/[problem-name]
python [problem-name].py
```
